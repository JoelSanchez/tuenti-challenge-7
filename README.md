## Tuenti Challenge 7

Tuenti Challenge 7 solutions implemented in Clojure.

Number 5 is actually a beginning for the challenge 14, because I did a port scan on the server, found the blackjack game and thought that was the way to go. I solved it using a shell script that you can find under the resources/challenge5 directory.

Number 7 is in resources/challenge7/script.js.

Number 9 is probably not correct on other cases not considered by the test case.

Number 10 uses two shell scripts found under the resources/challenge10 directory.

Number 11 is a disaster and did not pass the test case, please don't look at it. This is actually solved by using [Dijkstra's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm) and a [hypergraph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypergraph), as said by Tuenti's engineering team.
